Dear Organization, In my opinion computers are wonderfull to the society in many ways. They can keep memories we cant keep forever like Caps, Caps's, and type letters. Computers also can give you dieting tips and advice from live locals. But, important of all of it, family that you miss can talk to you for hours without a phone bill. To begin, computer can give you Caps tips on things you didn't know, so it can also be a learning center. For example: your extremely stresed out because you have a huge paper to do but have no facts, there are a millions websites you could go to find your answers on. The next day you get your paper back and theres a A stamped right across it. Another Caps thing about computers is that you can talk to your family members all the way in a different city, town, state, or even content! you Month miss them alot but you can always see them to them or type to them to let that sad feelings melt away for a little bit. Every num in num americans say missing or not seeing a family member is like letting a little piece of your heart fall off. Everybody knows what its like to have a memory that you could never forget:  but what about those little memories that Caps, websites, and written work seems to slip away from the brain. Computers save all of that so the "I know its to its like to loose its like a little part of life that you have lived walks always" exclaims Person who could This is exactly why computer in many ways. I hope you are Caps for the mind, tips and family.
