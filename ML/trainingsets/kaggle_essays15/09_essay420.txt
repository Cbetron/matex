Dear Caps people, Your have been told that using a Caps can give no knolege, but I agree that it gives you hand-eye cordanation, A Caps is the most helpful thing in the world. For my first reason, computers have so many technology things inside that help people everyday. I want to talk about interacting with family and friends. You can go on facebook, myspace and even twitter to talk to your friends. Its the most common thing to go on the Caps. About percent teens and adults use myspace and facebook. Litter kids would be like percent use Caps to interact with some friends. This technology is the most best thing you could ever use. The second reason is, that people need to learn how to use a Caps and the hand-eye cordination. For learning, you could learn how to type, write stories, using Organization word, and even learning whats to use on the internet, for hand-eye cordination, you can learn all the keys an the keyboard and what they do to get better skills. My thirdly reason is, how to search on google or the Location. Google is the most common thing that everyone uses. To look up pictures for projects, labs basiclly for anything. And for the dictionary, you can see what words mean and the dictionay is for learning and doing homework. For my conclusion all these reasons are true and computers are the greatest sources on the planet, everyone do you want education or not? computers help everyone. You gotta love it!?!
