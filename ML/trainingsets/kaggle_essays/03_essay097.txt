Dear Local newspaper, I think computers benefit society greaty. Most of what we do today could not happen without computers. The biggest use of computers is comunication. If you're in Location on a buisnoss trip but need to send a letter to your company, you can send an emil which is much less expensive than paying for as piece of Caps. The experts concerns that people aren't spending enough time with family and friends is a point. Many people cominucate with family and friends through computers. I would hardely yet to talk to my cousin if I couldn't go on facebook. I would have had to wait another Month to find out my other cousin was engaged if I didn't follow her on Caps. If the concern is face to face contact, the computer has a cure for that, too, a video messaging site called ooVoo. Another way computers allow comunication is through the shareing of information. Many facts needed for school are spread out in hundreds of books. Over the Caps, I've done research for a project and have been able to get facts from the Organization and Organization about crime stats. Many times researching an animal will take you online because more modern books note good website to travel to for more information. Without the Caps, a simple reasearch project could take for Months. Some scientists think people are spending too much time on the computer. This both right and wrong. Sitting at a computer watching youtube for hours is not nessasarily the best thing. However, the Caps is also for computer. The Caps has designed a game so that you can have fun while getting excersize. Computers are like chocolate. They can be good, but too much is a bad thing.
