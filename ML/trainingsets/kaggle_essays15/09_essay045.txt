Dear Location, Caps you think the computers don't help you with research? Well, if you really think about it computers Caps help you. You can't always gain wait by just looking or staying on a computer. And you can defenetly still talk with kids, friends, and family members on computer. Caps you no if books have all the information you need for school project, or your own family history. Maybe books have our history of wars and of our heros. Try and see if you can find the first ancestor of your family. The computer are the reasons why we no our history and know about actors, slaves, sergents, and much more. Have you gain weight just from staying on the computer for too long. I haven't gain a pound or an ounce since I've been on computer. Not only can you gain weight or lose weight just by being on the computer. How Caps you know if the Person on the computer is not looking for diet foods or fat free things? Or if the Person is eating while being on the computer. Caps you get large phone bills just for a two minute long distance call? Why Caps you think we have enternet websites such as myspace, facebook, twitter, msn and lots more. Most of my family members life in Location, Location, and Location and just for a call its like ten dollars for a minute. While you can be on the internet for about day to night and still pay the same price. So what Caps you choose pay over thirty dollars just for a long distance call or stay on the computer. Or get bad grades for doing the bad research. Its you chooce, choose now if either talk with family and friends on phone and pay over your bill money or stay on web chat for how long you want and still get the same bill price.
