Dear Caps, Caps since electricity was invented technology has developed at a rapid rate. Computers have gone from the size of a room to twelve inch flat screen monitors. In our modern day society computers are crucial tools that help organize files, do reasearch, and pleasurable online networking. Computers teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places, and allow people to socialize online. Without computers wouldn't life be difficult? While routinely doing our everyday computer tasks seldom do we realize that we are writing which frequently over works nerves in the hand causing tendonitis or arthritis; typing on computers is quicker and less harmful to the hands. "Hand eye coordination helps improve balance and athleticisniry." said Person the chief othopedic sergeon of Organization. Some people beg to differ and believe spending not less time on the computer can contribute to lack of physical activity. There are several portible computer devices that can be brought outside to use while walking like a Caps. Every since I was, ten years old I dreamed of going to Location. Although I couldn't afford a plane ticket to Location, I was able to use the internet to take virtual tours of the vibrant landscapes and ancient historic venues throughout the country. With the help of internet I was able to see a far away place and experience the country as if I was there. Person, the creator of an online webcom called Organization. Person created this computer system in order to allow people to connect all over the world by giving them the opportunity to see and speak to anyone they chosse to.
