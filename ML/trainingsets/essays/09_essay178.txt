Dear, organization play a big role in our world today. For example people use computers to get imformation, talk in chat rooms, mainly to talk to friends and fined friends. I think this caps messing people up. My first reson for thinking computers caps messing people up caps because of the impformation that caps on the website. For example people past, and blog lies about people online. This caps ruining many people because this starts rumors and gossip about people. Also the lies that are being posted could interfear with many lives. Another reason computers effect the lives and people caps the dangerous chat rooms. This caps not good because your not familliar with the person your talking too. The person could have posed as another person and be very hipocritical. The result of this could be very unpleasent. Like you might give them you number, adress, caps personal imformation. The outcome to endup in death, kidnapping, caps ciber bullying. Lastly, I want to talk about the false imformation that caps given to thousands of people online. Another words the"caps, caps caps Your caps love" caps" caps Your caps caps On You?" caps these things are placed on either side of your screen to get money from you. On the other hand they attract the readers attention. For example these passages are set to copy down your number, get your account number then take your money. This doesnt help our peole because its only there for your money. In conclusion from my veiwible stand piont I dont prefer computers a magnificient way for people to spend there time on.
