Dear Caps I support that computers have a positive effect on people because they have so many things to do and learn on the computer, because on the computer you can look up many things like sports, animal world history and lot more. The reason I support this is because I like to look up history about Caps and Caps pioneer who have changed humanity. The Caps reason why I say computer effect people is because it teaches you how to type faster and know now to get certain places on the computer for example say you mom was asked you do you know how to get to a certain website to buy new furniture. Caps third reason of how computers effect people is if say one day you had to do a project, on what happen during Caps revolution and you were one of those people that spend all their time looking up Caps revolution on the computer. That means that project should be real easy. The Caps reason why I say computers affect people is because they teache better communicating skills on things like facebook and Caps, because when I'm in school kids tell each other to go on there facebook when they get home. I also think computer affect people because say you have a idol and wan't to look up that person for example I like football, basketball Caps idols are Person peterson and Person iverson, so everytime I go on the computer I look up both of Caps idols. Caps last reason why I say computers effect people are because they teach how to read because everytime on the computer haves something to read about no matter what it is.
