Dear, location caps I think the use of computers are good, here are some reasons why? My first reason is you can find stuff online. My second reason is you can have fun. My last reason is you can make location friends. I will write num paragrahs explaining my reasons. Going back to my introduction my first reason was you can find stuff online. If you can't find a job you can go online and find some. If you want to go to college but you have no time you can take classes online. Those are my details to support my reason. My second reason was the computers are so fun. To me they are fun because when you are bored you can play games. If you are not a game person you can play servays. Or you can find out facts. That how I can back up my second reason. My third reason was you can meet location people. You can meet location people be search them up if you are trying to find a old friend. Or there is social networking such as myspace, facebooks, twitter etc which you can meet location people. Mostly everyone would like to meet location people. To end this story my num reason was yo can find stuff online, my second reason was you can have fun. My last reason was you can meet location people.
