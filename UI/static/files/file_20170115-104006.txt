===ANFANG TEXT===
Germany is home to me, and I can count myself happy to live here. In Germany, nearly nobody has to ask for sparechange or is forced to live by road. In all of Europe many people have an employment and needn't fear for existence.
Since I was a child, I have been interested in the destinies of people from all over the world, no matter who they are or where they live, and I nearly have to cry when I think about all the people, that suffer from gross injustice.
The most people don't care about that, but I do. For a considerable time I am working at the counseling in my native „Lörrach“. I love it to help people in difficult situations and I wish I could spend much more time on it.
I am currently attending Hans-Thoma-Gymnasium, where I spend some time, working on science-projects. My leisure I spend with helping my family to renovate their house and the evening I visit the local Boxing-Club.
I would be very happy to spend a gap year in Africa to help this poor people improve their lives in many ways, before I am going to start learning to get prepared, so that I can take my A-Levels.
