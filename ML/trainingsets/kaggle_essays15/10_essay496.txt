Dear Newspaper Caps, Caps you like it if your children stay on the computer all the time? I wouldn't children or even adults won't spend time with family, kids will be unhealthy, and lastly they can get addicted to using the computer and computer language. Please keep reading to hear my ideas. To begin with, children or even adults won't spend as much time with their family. For example percent of people will stay on the computer all day and won't even worry about their kids. i remember when I read on facebook that the guy was so into a game he was playing that he didn't answer the phone when they tould him his son got hit by a car. Now, news lpaper Caps, Caps you wan't your son going through what that man's son went through? I don't think so. Also, kids or adults will be unhealthy and not exercise. A study was shown and percent of people who use the internet don't exercise or work out. out of that percent, percent are suffering from obeasity. my cousin is always on the computer and the doctor tould him to minimize how muchtime your on it because hes obeast. He weighs num pounds due to being on the computer all the time. So tell me, newspaper Caps Caps you want your kids to be abease. Lastly, now-a-days kids are "obsessed" with the computer an computer. Percent of people who use the computer use the computer language in school. And out of that percent put internet on their phone so they can go on myspace, facebook, ect. Now, newpaper Caps, what Caps happen if you wrote computer language in your article woudn't you get fired? In conclusion, i hope you took my letter into concideration. kids or adults will be unhealthy, kiods will be too obsessed with the computer and lastly they won't spendtime with family.
