Life's question:  My life's question is, why there is so much war and poorness in this world.
 We kids in Germany have a good life.
We get education and we have food an we have water as much as need.
For us are these things taken for granted, but in other countries like for example Africa, the kids have got no right for education so they aren't able to go to school.
They don't have unlimited water.
They usually have to walk for miles to get just one bottle of water.
They have to work hard but they an their family don't get much money so they can't buy something to eat.
These bad conditions are often the reason for war in such lands.
The people don't like the government in their countries and want more rights.
But the problem is, that the poor people haven't got any opportunities to change something.
They can go on the street and demonstrate, but mostly, they have no chance against the powerful government.
And sometimes, you just can try to beat these powerful people with weapons.
That is because there is so much war and millions of people lose their lifes every year.
I don't know how to find a solution for all these problems, but every one of us can help to make the world a bit better.
We can try to help poor people with donations or accommodate refugees (like it happens now here in Germany).
What Germany does is really social, but we all know that we can't accommodate all the refugees who are going to come to Germany.
So we have to dispose of the reasons why the people come to us.
 I think that I as a single person can't change something, but our government has enough power to make the world better.
And together with other countries, we should be able to make the world better!
