Dear people from the newspaper, I am concerned that people take too much time on the computer because it could cause trouble, voilence, & illegal crimes. First, I am concerned that people spend too much time on the computer because it couses trouble, in date, percent date people in the location, do bad stuff like starting rumors, & saying bad stuff about people they dispise, in the date, percent date teens form ages num were envolven with the rumor spreading. This would be bad for all children. All these reasons will lead to the num below. Secondly, I am concerned that people spend too much time on the computer because it couses voilence, because date the reasons started in the num paragraph, if all this continues, then it month & lead to voilence, in date num people died from all the crimes online. Num threats were found online from big websites like caps, caps & caps. Lastly, I am concerned that people spend too much time on the computer because it could lead to illegal crimes, In date a girl was talking to a boy online then when they decided to meet, he shot & killed her. It turned out he was just a person who lied about who he was online, caps on a website online, a group date men were talking about now much they hated kids so they decided to shot them at their bus stops. Thank god that the police caught them before they were to do the crime In conclusion, I am concenred that people are spending too much time on the computer because it causes trouble, voilence, & illegal crimes. This caps like totally needs to stop before everyone is addicted to spreading rumors. Thank you for your time in reading this letter
