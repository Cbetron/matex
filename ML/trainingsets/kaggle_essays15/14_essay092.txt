Typing helps you if you want to become a secretary or even a newspaper editor. My mother is a secretary down town at the low form called: Organization. She works for three houses so she learned to type really fast. Typing is a big part of your life.

They've helped me my whole life. To be continued, computers have a positive effect on people. They help interact with other people students, and fa mily members, when not in contact.
