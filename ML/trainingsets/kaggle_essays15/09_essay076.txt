Dear local newspaper, Caps best friend, Location, was once a nerd with no hand-eye coordination, Caps, he started to use a computer and now he has better hand-eye coordination than me. Computer not only teaches hand-eye coordination, but Caps gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people,and millons people to talk on line with other people. Caps friend wasn't the only Person who learn hand-eye coordination. About percent of people learn hand-eyes coordination using a computer. Caps might takes some Month to learn, but once a child knows Caps, they will be outside for hours. Who would not want to learn hand-eye coordination? In addition, computer gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people. Computer engineer, Person, says, "num in every num people learn about places and people threw the internet." Caps will take a few hours, but you will be educated. Why would someone think we are spending too much time in the internet if we are being educated? Addionally, don't you have a friend who live more than num miles away from you? If you do, Caps a computer will solve your problem of communication. Caps friend, Location, lives num miles away from me. We communicate using hotmail, yahoo, and facebook. The best thing of all is that is free unlike a telephone. Futhermore, computer specialist, Person, says, "I learned hand-eye coordination using a computer. Most importantly, i was able to hand in Caps essay on time because of the information a computer provides and i was able to communicate with Caps family." I didn't want to tell you this, but i was also a nerd with no hand-eye coordination and i learned just like Location learned. We aren't spending too much time, we are just being educated.
