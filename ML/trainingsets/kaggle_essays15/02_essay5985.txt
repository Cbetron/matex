The affects of the cyclist is if it does not change. it cut hurt a lot of people feeling because they Caps don’t care about the cyclist. I’m one of them people who does not care about it cause it does not affect me or anyone I know. It is a big deal to write people, some of them Caps blow stuff up. They talking on tiv and on the radio making all this stuff they say is made up. I don’t believe to I see it. That Caps not for black people because it has not did anything to us. We really don’t care about the affects of the cyclist.
