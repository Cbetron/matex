Dear Caps, In my opinion I think we should use computers. The reason why I think we should use computers because Caps we need help on something, we can find it on the computer, also because sometimes that is the only way you can get in touch with someone, and sometimes people Month have to go on the computer and check instant mail. Frist of all, I think we should use computers because Caps we need help on something we can find it on the computer. For example, Caps a student need help on homework they can go on google and look on the they doing and it will help. Also They can go on a website called http.historywork.com and that will also help that on what. Another reason why I think we should use computer because sometimes that is the only way you can get in touch with someone. When I say this I mean like Caps you have a computer connect with them on the computer. For example like Caps you have a gmail, facebook, yahoo or myspace you can talk to you friends at there. I do it all the time. Last reason why I that we should use computer is because sometimes Month have to go on the for example Caps you Month had important message the website and you message you. I do it why can't you. So yes I do their.
