Dear Newspaper people, caps opinion's on what effect's do computer's have on people is without the computer we couldn't research important people and event's. Also we couldn't type important paper's. Last we can talk to other people. Now that caps first opinion is without the computer we couldn't research important people and events. This is one of caps reason's because if people didn't know anything about an important person they could look them up. For an example who is harry person. He was the num president. I didn't know who he was or what he did until I looked him up on the internet. Caps second opinion is we wouldn't be able to type important paper's. I say this because people that have caps's mostly have to type paper's. And without the computers everything would have to be hand-writen. Also some people have bad hand writing. Caps last opinion is we can type to people that are online and offline. I say this because if you have to tell a family member, or a friend something important but, you phone is dead or broken you can e-mail them. Or if you have a facebook you can tell them on that. Last you can I.M them. Now that you know three opinion's on what effects computer's have, people can alway's excrise around there house or around there block.
