Dear Caps Caps Caps, I am writing this letter to State my opinion on the effects computers have on people. And there are three of them: Caps theft, cyberbully, addition. Now I will write one paragraph about each. My first reason why I feel that computers have bad effects is. Caps theft many people in the Caps.S.A identities get stolen for listing private information online (computer) which can leave that Person in a lot of debt. How are we going to encourage people to use computers when their at the risk of getting their Caps stolen. If this happening to innocent people it needs to stop we must'nt encourage this online behavior so say no to computers. i understand it really is interesting to learn about people from different countries but their are some cons. Talking online to people you don't know and have never seen, met in Person they can pose as someone famous and bully you for their enjoyment. It has been proven that when children even adults get cyberbullied can lead them in the path of depression even suicide. Now I find it quite febble-minded to give up your life for a computer. So again I say no to computers. My last reason why I say no to computers is because people become addicted to the excitement of the computers when eventually lead to the division from friends and family because your lost in the computer world also you forget about you hygene some people even forget to eat. This thing they call computer is a drug, a drug that makes you forget about reality and everything else you used to think of and bring you to computer land. And I say no to computers. I have gave you my opinion and three supporting reasons why I feel the way I do which were because Caps theft, cyberbullying, addiction. Say no num computers.
