Then when you go to check your eyes, the Doctor will probably give a glasses. My second reason is that people go to inappropriate sites and watch inappropriate videos. One time my friend was sitting in the computer and she started to watch inappropriate videos Caps when her father found out about this, he canceled their internet.
