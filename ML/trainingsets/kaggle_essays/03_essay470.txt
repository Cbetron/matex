Dear Organization, This leter I am writing to you is about how computers affect people. I am concerned about computers use in our society because people that spend too much time on the computer spend less time outdoors, exercising, and with family and friends. Let me tell you modre about it... As stated in the paragraph above, one reason I am concerned about computer use is that less time is spent outdoors."Everyone, young or old, should get outside for some fresh air for at least num minutes everyday," Person. Using the computer could limit this time, and that probably isn't healthy being in the house all day. A second reason Caps worry shout over- usage of computers relates to the first reason. Too much time on the computer limits the amount of exercise you get everyday. "People should exercise an hour a day to stay healthy," ssays health expert Person," however percent of people don't because of computers." this happens often especially if you are playing a fun game with many levels. You plan to play for num minutes, but the num minutes turns into num minutes, which Month even turn into an hour! I know still Month be hard to understand why I'm concerned about using computers, Caps I have one more reason. My final reason in this letter of why I don't like over using computers is that it limits the time that can be spent with family and friends. How of you can see your family and friends on the computer using a webcam. But it's not the same as spending quality time. "Friends come and go and you and your family won't live forever," says therapist Person", Caps motor the best of that you have." there won't be many if you eyes are glued to the computer screen. As you can see there reasons why I am concerned about people spending time on the computer. There's less time to exercise enjoy nature and interact with family and friends. I hope you take this into concideration.
