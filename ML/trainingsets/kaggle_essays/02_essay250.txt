I do not believe computers benefit society. Many people spend their life on their computer instead of exercising, going out with friends, or spending time with family. Num? Of Caps will agree they spend at least num hours a day on their computer. Which is unneccessary. Why is there so much obesity in the world nowadays? Because of a lack of Caps. And who is the #num cul? Computers of course. In order for more people to maintain healthy, there needs to be a lot of Caps. When someone can sit around all day clicking a mouse or typing keys in, how much Caps are they really getting? Plus, there are many different disorders in the world. Percent inf will agree that with more Caps, these sometimes painful disorders could be avoided. Too many people are choosing their computer overexercise and it them many health problems that could've easily been avoided. Secondly, everyone would agree that friends are essential in life. But now people are talknig to their friends online or in computer games instead of going to the them. Online there is much more which often break up friendship. Also, online you new people or make as many new friends. Caps you go and have many more friends, which makes life in general much better. Finally, you wouldn't wants families become would you? Well, this is one of the many effects the Caps members of a family get together which could weaken them as a family. Plus, husbands and wives could not talk very often, often leading in separation or devorce. This could make a child have in decide between a whole family to Caps, friends, and family are essential in life, and computers put those in jeopardy. So take a stand and end this reign for good, stop the use of computers before it is too late.
