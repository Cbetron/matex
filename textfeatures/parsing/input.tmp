I believe the reactions of most people who read the text are similar.
It’s a typical story about raising money for homeless and poor people, which is always very nice and affecting.
I’ve read and watched such scenes often in books and in the Internet, but this time it’s a bit different.
In this story there are more aspects.
First there’s the boy called Andy who behaves badly in church.
Caused by this, the parents of his friend Tommy want to isolate their son from him.
What they don’t know, is that Andy’s very social and later helps a homeless man.
Secondly Tommy is less social and against the offered help.
He’s brought up more conservative by his parents.
But Tommy learned from Andy and reassesses his attitude.
The last aspect I want to elaborate is a criticism of society and church: Mrs Skeffington who’s devout doesn’t offer help to an old woman, but this barefaced boy does.
 I believe it’s right how Andy treated the homeless man.
It’s more important than the good behaviour in church, what doesn’t mean that it’s okay how he acted there.
He should also respect the religion and its meaning to many people.
His way to help is clever.
He said, he never gives money but he enters the restaurant and pays for the food.
I really like how he communicates with the man.
After they went in, he started to talk with him.
Maybe that’s something what the  man doesn’t experiences often.
In his monologue Andy explains, that Tommy’s bad at sports but he’s in a team anyway, which can teach the man, that everybody can reach achievements if he wants to.
After giving him the chance for an answer, what is quite friendly, Andy talks about the good weather.
That seems irrelevant but maybe cheers the man up.
All this is friendly and clever, and makes the reader think very good of Andy.
 Overall the story is very entertaining and makes the reader reflect about the struggle of homeless persons and the help one can offer.
