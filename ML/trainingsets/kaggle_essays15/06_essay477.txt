Dear, Organization Caps opinion is getting out of mind. They're people who are getting addicted to to Caps, such as games, websites, communication and email websites and etc. Therefore, they're people who are just plain addicted to the computer, such as Caps. I know people who are addicted on Caps because, they get addicted to talking to people, and looking at other people. So they dont cooperate correctly with there school work (so they get bad grades) or they loose connection with family members and friends (so they become lonely and depressed). Then thier only friend is the computer. Also other effects on the computer is if your addicted to a website (in generaal) you can get out of shape, because your not spending enough time excersing, there is already enough people in Location that is obesed and it is already a add on to the problem. I read online than in Location is obesed. So computers are a addiction waiting to happen. Therefore people need to start spending time friends and start excersing and stay away from the computer.
