If you control the amount of time you use on a computer then you will be fine. Please keep reading to hear my great ideas. To start off, computers and other technology make life easier. Think about it we have access to our bank accounts, stores, reasearch, school, etc. See instead of having to go at shoppingfor food you could just order it online with no trouble. We can now shop Caps cloths and other household items. It'so easy just to look at a list and pick what you want instead of waiting in a long line. Caps example, I went to Caps to pick up a few items Caps a party. There a long line, so I just got online picked what i wanted and had it shipped to me unless then num hours! Its cool to not have to even got up to get what you want. I know you sometimes have your since you don't wanna get up? But you have to go shopping. Doesn't computers make life so easy. Secondly, talk to family and friends without having to spend money. This is awesome because you can text, video chat, email Caps free.

And it was num times better and free and better. Even Caps people long distanceis way to much money in call them. So why not just video chat I know you wouldn't wanna spend hundreds of dollars Caps a phone call bill! Please keep reading. Thirdly, if you count he amount of time you use on he computer of other technology devices then you will be fine. If you limit and set a time on the use of your computer everything will be wonderful. You can tell your body to get off the pc and get a work out or talk to friends. There's no way you could be addicted to something if you have a limited Caps it. If your the type of person that is a at something. Then Month be you shouldn't get a computer. Like my mom gives me a limited Caps the computer num my laptop has to be off on a school night. An num:00pm my laptop has to be off on the weekends. There's alway ways to not to be addicted. You just have to know when enough is enough. Its not the computers fault. Just have to control yourself.
