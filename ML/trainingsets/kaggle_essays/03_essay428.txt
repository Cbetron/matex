Dear local Newspaper, People spending time on the Caps is a good way for people to connect with one each other. But it can also be a way for people to get in trouble with things online like looking at things they shouldn't be looking at strangers they shouldn't be talking or typing to or even predators that could be online. Percent Organization kids and adults go on the computer either when their getting out Organization school for the day or if they are getting off Organization work for the day or if they are getting off Organization work for the night, they are just there on the computer to check upon things and for the kids either for their entertainment, for like chatting with friends on some king Organization program, or Organization their even playing a game online. Three fourths Organization kids under age num go online more than adults age num because Organization the interest in what is on it. People sometimes say, "oh, I only go on the computer to check up on things. It only takes me a few minutes", But they are lying. Most people dont just go on for a couple Organization minutes, their on for more like a few hours, and that effect their relationship or connection to ones family and or friends. Person at the Organization says, "people spend hours on the computer looking at what ever they want and most people do that and it has to stop for the sake Organization the persons family and friends," Person also said," Caps like an addiction". Do you really want to have an addiction? I didn't think so, so instead Organization just sitting there storing into a screen for hours aday go outside and have fun with your friends or family, go to the Caps, the beach, even just take a walk in the park. Nothing can beat the feeling Organization being with friends or family and just having fun.
