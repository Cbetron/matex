Dear, Organization you agree with what I'm trying to tell about people use the computer more than exsersise? Well first more and more people use computers but how does it benifit them. Secondly, they are spending to much time on their computer than exercising. Finally they spend less and less time with their family and being active. First more and more people use computers but how does that benifit them. Computers is just a adicting technology that makes you lazy and slow. Does using the computer Caps you with problems your having with your family...Caps! Well I know this from ex perience. My mom is always on face book and I hate it I figure she loves the computer more then Caps do you want your kids to think that about you? As the days pass by her time on the computer increase and Caps sitting there needing Caps on homework and i'm thinking Caps Caps YOU Caps"Caps Caps Caps Caps Caps. See i was just thiking that cause Caps I said that it's a rap for Caps but Caps just trying to say this computer went benifit anyone Caps way. Second I want to inform the Caps Caps paper is that people are spending more time on the computer than exsercising. The obeast rate has been higer than it ever been. I believe by percent! COME ON this is Caps! people come home by Caps and other fast food num go on the computer and eat. Over time you get bigger and your apperence change. You began to look sloppy and nobody wants you. You look back and regret doing what you did. Finally you spend less and less time with you family. This causes you grow apart from your family your kids pick up bad habbits and do the opposite of what you want them to do. This tells Caps that the computer is just Caps good at all. In conclusion I informed you on why I dislike computers. They Caps benift you. Makes you lazy and keeps you from you kids. So do oyou the local Caps paper agree?
