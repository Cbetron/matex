Dear Caps, People are using too much Organization their time on the computer. Instead Organization seeing the Organization through their own eyes they are seeing it on videos or in Caps on the internet. It isn't natural for people to be internet fanatics. Earth is a beautiful planet, it has trees, mountain, seas, and humas. We creators the internet and people love it more man the rock they're standing on. The planet should be explored not surfed in the web. People should see the Organization before all natural hand is coverd by cities and factories. People use the internet way to much for plans, for business, for entertainment, for a social life! all Organization this has been done with ease before we could even on a light bulb. Life is a gift and people spend it on artifitial life. For example a game, Organization is one Organization the most popular addictive games ever made. In this game you make a character in a miderth planet while you battle m onster with other players. Some people think that game is funner than life (personaly I think it is) but is not their life. His just a fantasy for people to escape thier meaningless lives. I write this for suport that some day people will understand that this is life. So, live it.
